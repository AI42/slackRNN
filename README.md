# min-char-rnn in Scala

This is a reimplementation of Andrej Karpathy's min-char-rnn.py code that was written in Python/Numpy.
This reimplementation builds on `Breeze` from Scala NLP and is written in Scala.
Otherwise, it should perform the same.

Original Python code: <https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086>

## Disclaimer

As of now, this doesn't yet perform as exepected. The code compiles and runs, but the outputs from training
are not satisfactory...
